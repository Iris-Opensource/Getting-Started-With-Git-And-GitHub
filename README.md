## Making Your First Contribution

**First off, if you don't have git set up on your machine, [install it here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).** <br/>
Once that's done, come back here and follow these steps ! <br /><br />

   #### 1. Fork this repository
   #### 2. Clone the repository
  Now clone the **forked repository** to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon to copy the url of the repo. <br />
  Open your terminal and run the following git command:<br />
   ```
   git clone <url you just copied>
   ```
Remember to clone **your forked repository** , not the original one.

#### 3. Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):<br />
   ```
   cd Getting-Started
   ```
   
   Now create a branch using the git checkout command: <br />
   ```
   git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
   ```
   
 #### 4. Add the necessary details
   
   Woohoo! You're almost there! Open the `contributors-list.md` file and add your name and a little about yourself ! <br />
   
#### 5. Commit your changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status` in the terminal, you'll see there are changes. <br />
   Add the changed files to the branch you just created using the `git add` command: <br />
   ```
   git add contributors-list.md
   ```

   Now commit those changes using the git commit command:
   ```
   git commit -m "your message"
   ```
   
#### 6. Push your changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
   ```
   git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
   ```
